Implement a sorting algorithm - MergeSort(ascending/descending)

  ### Result output
  + Algorithm's name
  + Execution time
  + Counters: swaps, comparisons 
  + Sorting result
  ###  Code must be covered with tests
  + sort the input array
  + sort in ascending order of sorted array in ascending order
  + sort in descending order of sorted array in ascending order
  + sort in ascending order of sorted array in descending order
  + sort in descending order of sorted array in descending order
  
  ## Installation
  + Download the project and open main.py file
  + Click terminal
  + Print `python ./main.py [array]` in console and press Enter *(example: python .main.py 1, 4, 7, 3, 2, 9)*
